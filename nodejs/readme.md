What is Node (or Node.js)?

Node.js is a tool that lets you run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, usually on your computer or a server.

Normally, JavaScript runs in the browser (like on websites).

Node.js lets you use JavaScript for backend development, like building servers, APIs, or running scripts.

# To run a JavaScript file using Node.js, use the following command in your terminal:

node file_name.js

Example:

node name.js
