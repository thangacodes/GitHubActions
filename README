Terraform scripts are kept in the terra-codes folder, while OIDC roles with IAM policies have been updated in the AWS_IAM_ROLE_POLICY folder.

The following is needed to integrate OpenID Connect (OIDC) with GitHub actions on AWS:
a) Custom trust policy for IAM ROLE
b) You will need inline policies for services you want to communicate with over GitHub actions

In this example, The IAM role has access to Amazon Web Services like EC2 and S3 buckets.
